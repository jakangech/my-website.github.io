<h1 id="color1">ABOUT ME</h1>
<p>I am a Kenyan male aged 26, currently enrolled as a student of IT at JKUAT University and Moringa School. I am a graduate of Laboratory Medicine from the University of Nairobi's Medical School. <br> I consider myself an enterprising young professional with interests in both medicine and Information Technology.<br> In particular, I am interested in data science, particularly big-data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning and Bionforatics.<br> My aim is to merge my IT knowledge with medicine in solving society's problem.
  <p>My decision to enroll for the Moringa Prep program was informed by my desire to have hands-experience with coding in an environment that mirrors the real-life workplace environment. Moringa is a unique place to learn coding because students are not only exposed to quality contents, but also taken through a journey of personal and professional development. My plan is to finish the Moringa Core program and immeditaly apply for Moringa Core</p>
  <p>PS: I'm very passionate about blue color and this explains my background theme. What is your favorite color?</p>
